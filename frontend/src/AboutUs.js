      <p>
        Since first opening our doors in 1985, Nature Pet Centers has always
        been considered as leaders in the Pet Industry. As of September 2014, we
        has decided to take a huge step forward and further our leadership
        skills in being the first and only Pet Store chain in Quebec to stop
        selling puppies and kittens. Our focus and initiatives are solely in
        Rescue and Adoption and helping out the Shelters within our community
        and abroad in finding homes for the thousands of unwanted and abandoned
        pets. When adopting a Dog or Cat from Nature Pet Centers, you are not
        just saving ''a'' life, you are giving a chance and opening the door to
        many more. We want to be part of the solution, and adopting is one of
        the best ways of helping, and end pet homelessness and abandonment. All
        of our Dogs and Cats in adoption are also spayed and neutered because we
        want to fight against pet overpopulation as well. Aside from Pet
        Adoption, we offer Pet Grooming, as well as complete lines of products
        not only for Dog and Cat lovers, but for the Small Animal, Bird, Reptile
        and Fish enthusiasts. We pride ourselves in being Pet Experts with
        passionate, skilled and dedicated staff. Our main goal is to find you
        and your family exactly what you are looking for, a happy and healthy
        pet, offer the best advice and care possible, in a warm and friendly
        atmosphere. At Nature Pet Centers, we’re not just Animal Lovers…..
