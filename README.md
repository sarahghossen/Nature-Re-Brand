<h1> Welcome to Pet Centre Nature üêæ</h1>

<p>I'm excited to present to you my final project for Concordia's web development bootcamp! I decided to recreate and rebrand Pet Centre Nature's website because I felt that there was a lot of missing potential when it came to who they are as an organization and how they represented it through there website. I wanted to give it more of a modern and refreshing feel as well as smoother user experience and clear navigation.</p>

Tools I used include: React.js, Redux, Node.js and MongoDB. 

<i>üö®Note:</i> This project is for educational purposes only and Pet Centre Nature retains 100% of their intellectual properties and brand. Not all information is accurate to Pet Centre Nature. Find out more about them here: http://en.naturepet.com/

<h1>Virtual Tour‚ú®</h1>

<p> I will be going through all the features available on the site at the moment. I will soon be adding more features to make the experience better! </p> 

<h2> Adoption Page </h2> 
<p>People are able to filter by the pets species so that they don't have to keep scrolling through the "All Pets" section. A cool feature I would like to add in the future would be a search bar if someone had a very specific pet in mind that they would like to look up for easy access.</p>

<h2> Book an Appointment </h2> 
<p>Once you choose a furry friend that you think would be the perfect fit, you would want to book an appointment. You're only allowed to submit the booking form once you fill out all the information. If the email is invalid or you already booked with that specific pet with the same email, you will recieve an error. Once you submitted successfully, you will recieve email confirmation with all of the details!</p>

<h2> Sign in/Sign up </h2> 
<p>This feature will be very practical once I add the favorite feature. Once added, you will be able to ‚ù§Ô∏èheart‚ù§Ô∏è a pet and add it to your favourites page so that way you won't forget the pet that you're interested in and you can continue browsing with no stress. </p>

<h2> Contact Us </h2> 
<p>A google maps API is being used to make it easier to view all of 7 locations. If you click on the marker, you can see all of the information for each store. The information is also posted on the side of the map. </p>
