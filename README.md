<h1> Welcome to Pet Centre Nature üêæ</h1>

<p>I'm excited to present to you my final project for Concordia's web development bootcamp! I decided to recreate and rebrand Pet Centre Nature's website because I felt that there was a lot of missing potential when it came to who they are as an organization and how they represented it through there website. I wanted to give it more of a modern and refreshing feel as well as smoother user experience and clear navigation.</p>

Tools I used include: React, Redux, Node and MongoDB. 

<i>Note:</i> This project is for educational purposes only and Pet Centre Nature retains 100% of their intellectual properties and brand. Not all information is accurate to Pet Centre Nature. Find out more about them here: http://en.naturepet.com/
